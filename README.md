Just a toy to get more familiarity with python tkinter for an up-coming work project.
Based of a website (geekforgeek I think it was) example. 
Modified to use classes, main/pause menu (w key options), 'infinite' (no walls) version....
Not great, but basically, considering, current snake.py as finished....
